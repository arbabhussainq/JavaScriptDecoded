/*
FOR OF LOOP:
The `for...of` loop is a modern and clean way to ** iterate over iterable objects ** in JavaScript, such as:
Arrays 
Strings  
Sets  
Maps etc...
Arrat of Objects: [ { }, { }, { } ]
Example:
*/
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
/*
for (const iterator of object) {
  iterator is the same as index which will iterate over the object, object basically means 
  the thing which you want to iterate over, It can be an object, String, Array etc.
}
